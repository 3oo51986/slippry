  <h2 class="page-title">Inspiration you say? Have a look at some of these examples.</h2>
  <p>We think Slippry is a pretty customisable slider, so we've included some (slightly random) combinations of options and the function settings and CSS (if applicable) to recreate them.</p>
  <p>Have you customised Slippry in an awesome way? Let us know at <a href="mailto:slippry@booncon.com">slippry (at) booncon.com</a>! We love to see what people do with Slippry.</p>
