Slippry.
The stuff you need without the stuff you don't.
</section>

<section>
  <div>
Responsive. Industry buzzword overkill? Almost certainly. Although it turns out finding a truly responsive slider isn't that easyâ€¦
</div>

<div>CSS & jQuery. Support your grandad's computer or only your hip friends?</div>

<div>Complex? Nahhh. Just need a slider that works out of the box? Slippry can do that. The provided SASS stylesheet and script options means you can have a beautifully minimal slider working in no time. </div>
