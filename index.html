  <h2>Get Started</h2>
  1. Upload the files to your site's javascript directory (usually 'js' or 'javascript')
  2. include the files in your sites <head> section. Copy the code below:
  <code>
    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/slippry.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/scripts.js"></script>
  </code>
  3. call the script in your scripts.js file
  <code>
    $('selector').slippry()
  </code>
  4. Done! You can customise the script options or styling with the included stylesheets and function parameters.

Slippry.
The stuff you need without the stuff you don't.

Responsive. Industry buzzword overkill? Almost certainly. Although it turns out finding a truly responsive slider isn't that easyâ€¦
</div>

<div>CSS & jQuery. Support your grandad's computer or only your hip friends?</div>

<div>Complex? Nahhh. Just need a slider that works out of the box? Slippry can do that. The provided SASS stylesheet and script options means you can have a beautifully minimal slider working in no time. </div>
